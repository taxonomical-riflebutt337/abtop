# abtop

**Like htop, but for your AI coding agents.**

See every Claude Code and Codex CLI session at a glance — token usage, context window %, rate limits, child processes, open ports, and more.

## Why

- Running 3+ agents across projects? See them all in one screen.
- Hitting rate limits? Watch your quota in real-time.
- Agent spawned a server and forgot to kill it? Orphan port detection.
- Context window filling up? Per-session % bars with warnings.

All read-only. No API keys. No network calls.

## Install

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/graykode/abtop/releases/latest/download/abtop-installer.sh | sh

powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://github.com/graykode/abtop/releases/latest/download/abtop-installer.ps1 | iex"

## Usage

```bash

```

Recommended terminal size: **120x40** or larger. Minimum 80x24 — panels hide gracefully when small.
